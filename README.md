> A C program that solves a 4x4 Skyscraper puzzle using backtracking, developed as part of the 42 School Piscine curriculum.

## üß© Overview

**Rush 01** is the second group project I completed during the 42 Piscine. My teammates [Mao](https://github.com/maozeitoun), Alex, and I earned a score of 95, and we're proud of it‚Äîthis was arguably the most challenging of the three group projects.

> ‚è±Ô∏è The project had to be completed in just 48 hours, making it feel like a mini-hackathon. Time pressure pushed us to collaborate efficiently, write clean code, and manage version control carefully.

The goal is to implement a C program that solves a **4x4 Skyscraper puzzle** using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The program accepts **16 clues** (representing visible skyscrapers from each side of the grid) and fills in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 so that:

- Each row and column contains each number exactly once.
- All clues are satisfied according to visibility rules.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### 1. Grid Representation

- The puzzle is stored in a `4x4` integer array: `int grid[4][4]`.
- Each cell holds a number between 1 and 4.
- Rows and columns must contain unique values.
- Clues are stored in an `int clues[16]` array.
- The grid is initially empty and filled using backtracking.

### 2. Input Handling

- The program takes **exactly 16 space-separated numbers** as input.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  ./rush-01 "1 4 2 2 4 1 2 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 2"
  ```

- Parsing and validation are handled in `input.c`:
  - Rejects non-numeric input (e.g., `"4 3 X 1 ..."` results in `"Error"`).
  - Ensures the input contains exactly 16 numbers.
  - Validates that numbers are within the range [1, 4].

### 3. Clue Validation

- Each clue represents the number of visible skyscrapers from a side.
- Taller buildings block the view of shorter ones behind them.
- The `count_visible_xx()` functions count visible buildings.
- The `check_clues()` function verifies the grid against all clues.

### 4. Backtracking Algorithm

- `solve_skyscraper()` is the core solver:
  - Starts at cell (0,0).
  - Tries placing numbers 1 through 4.
  - Uses helper functions like `isSafe()` to check for conflicts.
  - Recursively continues until a valid solution is found or backtracks when stuck.

## üîß How to Compile

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c -o rush-01
```

## üí° Notes

- This project reinforces understanding of recursion, backtracking, and input validation.
- A great way to practice algorithmic thinking in C.
- You can test your own puzzles or play interactively using this external site:

  It‚Äôs a fun way to experiment with clues and compare them with our solver‚Äôs results.
